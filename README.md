**Project : CSI heart project**

In this project I tried to find out the predictability of heart disease from real world data of 2250 people collected from 8 health camp sites across West Bengal

Method used: Cleaning the data, performed EDA, finding out the predictive power of feature variables using t-test/Annova test. 
Performing linear regression (OLS and PLS) to get the best predictive baseline model 
code CSI_model_ready.ipynb_ prepares the raw data before training the model
 Base_model.ipynb gives a basic model to get the probability of heart disease using variables which are most relavent.
key achievements:_ The final model was able to achieve adjusted R2 Score of 0.102 on test data which is a satisfactory 
result considering the data is physiological.
